# Button Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing onClick Handlers
Several buttons were missing `onClick` handlers, making them non-functional:

**Dashboard Page:**
- ✅ "Add Money" button - Added click handler with console logging
- ✅ "Set New Goal" button - Added click handler with console logging  
- ✅ "Emergency Withdrawal" button - Added click handler with console logging
- ✅ "Update Preferences" button - Already had navigation handler

**Index Page:**
- ✅ "Watch Demo" button - Added click handler with console logging

**Onboarding Page:**
- ✅ Experience level cards - Added state management and click handlers
- ✅ "Complete Setup" button - Added validation (only enabled when experience level is selected)

### 2. Visual Feedback Improvements
- Added hover effects to buttons for better user experience
- Added transition animations for smoother interactions
- Added visual feedback for selected experience levels in onboarding

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Added error handling for missing Clerk authentication key
- Added development mode warnings instead of throwing errors

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test button functionality:**
   - Open browser console to see click events
   - Navigate between pages using navigation buttons
   - Test quick action buttons on dashboard
   - Test experience level selection in onboarding

3. **Check console output:**
   - Button clicks should log messages to console
   - Navigation should work between pages
   - Experience level selection should show visual feedback

## Environment Setup

To enable authentication features, create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
```

## Next Steps

The buttons now have basic functionality with console logging. To implement full functionality:

1. **Add Money**: Connect to payment processing API
2. **Set New Goal**: Create goal management system
3. **Emergency Withdrawal**: Implement withdrawal functionality
4. **Watch Demo**: Add video player or modal
5. **Experience Level**: Save user preferences to backend
